## About
**Rates** is a small [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) desktop application for fetching and displaying exchange rates from the
[Open Exchange Rates web API](https://openexchangerates.org/). It currently only supports
[latest](https://docs.openexchangerates.org/docs/latest-json) and
[historical](https://docs.openexchangerates.org/docs/historical-json) exchange rates.


## Build
```
git clone https://github.com/altoukhov-max/rates.git
cd rates
mvn clean javafx:run
```
Alternatively, you can also simply open the cloned repository in IntelliJ IDEA. In any case, in order to properly use the app you'll
need to acquire an [Open Exchange Rates App ID](https://openexchangerates.org/signup).
