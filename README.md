## About
![Failed to load screenshot](win10_scr.png)

**Rates** is a small and extremely simple cross-platform desktop application for browsing exchange rates. It relies on the
[Frankfurter web API](https://github.com/hakanensari/frankfurter) as its primary data provider.

## Build
Proper build and installation instructions are currently unavailable. If you'd still like to run the application in a "development environment",
simply open it as a project in (probably) any modern IDE, such as [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
