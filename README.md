## About
![Failed to load screenshot](./docs/screenshots/rates_windows10.png)

**Rates** is a small cross-platform desktop application for fetching and displaying exchange rates from the
[Open Exchange Rates web API](https://openexchangerates.org/). It currently only supports
[latest](https://docs.openexchangerates.org/docs/latest-json) and
[historical](https://docs.openexchangerates.org/docs/historical-json) exchange rates.

## Build
Proper build and installation instructions are currently unavailable. If you'd still like to run the application in a "development environment",
clone this repository and run `mvn clean javafx:run` inside or simply open it as a project in (probably) any modern IDE, such as
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). In any case, in order to properly use the app you'll need to acquire an
[Open Exchange Rates App ID](https://openexchangerates.org/signup).
